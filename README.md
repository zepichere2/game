### Puzzle Strategies

#### üë• Cooperative Switches
- **Objective**: All players must stand on switches simultaneously
- **Strategy**: Coordinate movement and timing
- **Tip**: Use chat to synchronize your approach

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Synchronized Timing
- **Objective**: Activate switches within a 2-second window
- **Strategy**: Count down together and activate simultaneously
- **Tip**: Practice timing with emoji reactions

#### üî¢ Pattern Recognition
- **Objective**: Activate switches in the correct numerical sequence
- **Strategy**: Assign each player a number and follow the sequence
- **Tip**: Look for the sequence numbers above each switch

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies for maximum compatibility
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Smooth 2D rendering with pixel-perfect graphics
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients, shadows, and animations
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication with the server

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express**: Lightweight server framework
- **Socket.IO**: WebSocket-based real-time communication
- **In-Memory State**: Fast game state management (Redis optional for scaling)

### Game Engine
- **Physics System**: Custom gravity, collision detection, and movement
- **Level Generation**: Dynamic puzzle creation based on player count
- **State Synchronization**: Client-side prediction with server authority

## üé® Level Design Philosophy

Each level is designed to require **genuine cooperation** - no single player can complete a level alone. The puzzles are built around:

- **Communication Requirements**: Players must discuss strategies
- **Timing Coordination**: Some puzzles require perfect synchronization
- **Logical Thinking**: Pattern recognition and sequence solving
- **Adaptive Complexity**: Difficulty scales with team size

## üöÄ Deployment

### Environment Variables
```bash
PORT=3000  # Server port (default: 3000)
NODE_ENV=production  # Environment mode
```

### Production Deployment
The game is ready for deployment on platforms like:
- **Heroku**: Simple git-based deployment
- **Vercel**: Serverless deployment with edge functions
- **Railway**: Container-based deployment
- **DigitalOcean**: VPS deployment

### Docker Support
```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
